Design Goals


My group's design aimed to produce an attractive site, evoking a sense of calmness and serenity that highlights the company’s extraordinary amenities, a very functional site, validation checks and services. We created a unified look to the website using an easy to follow layout using breadcrumbs and employing the 3-click rule. We used image-rich pages to highlight the resort’s impeccable views, and provide a clear description of the services, activities, and accommodations. We implemented a user managament for our users and administrators. Only registred users are allowed to make spa reservations or buy spa packages. The administrator can approve or decline the reservations made by the user or delete a specified user on the admin's page.
